Welcome to Connect EaaS Core
============================

Welcome to **`Connect EaaS Core`**, the key building block that is 
required to create extensions for the CloudBlue Connect platform.

Your extension can be used for automating and streamlining various 
business scenarios. The functionality of your extension can also include 
the integration with your commerce system, extended features for Connect API and UI, 
and operations with a web interface built with [Anvil.Works](https://anvil.works/).

The following documentation provides developer guidelines, references 
and tutorials on how to create and configure an extension.
This documentation also introduceses the extension as a service 
(*EaaS*) concept, available extension types and extension anatomy. 

The EaaS functionality is managed via the **DevOps** module on the 
Connect platform. In case more information on this module is required, 
refer to [the Connect Community page](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/devops/).
