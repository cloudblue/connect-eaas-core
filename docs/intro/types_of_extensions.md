Connect supports three different types of extensions, 
each of which is intended for a specific type of integration:

## Fulfillment Automation

This type of extension is aimed at vendor who want to automate the fulfillment flow.

With this type of extension the vendor can listen to the events coming from the fulfillment 
queue and automate the provision of the services they sell.


## Hub Integration

This type of extension is aimed at distributors/resellers who want to integrate their
commerce systems through a Connect Hub.

With such type of extension a distributor/reseller can create for example purchase orders
in Connect reacting to events triggered by their commerce systems.

## Multi Account

The Multi Account Installation extension is the most powerful type of extensions.

They can react to the events emitted by Connect as well as they can extend the
Connect API and the Connect User Interface.

This type of extensions runs in the scope of a single Connect account but
can be installed and used by multiple Connect accounts.

Moreover, the extension developer can certify its extension and publish it
in the Connect Extensions Catalog.
